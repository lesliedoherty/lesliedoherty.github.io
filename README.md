# About Leslie

**Brief Introduction**

Hi. I’m Leslie. I’m an ENFP, 7 on the enneagram, a “People Driven Blue” on the corestrengths, and empathetic HSP. I won’t dive in to [my work history](http://lesliedoherty.github.io/), since there are several other [locations that host that information](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leslied/). This is a living document dedicated to my beliefs, expectations and commitments as a leader. In the spirit of those who have [positively influenced my career](https://github.com/iamEAP/how-to-eap), this document is available for feedback and accountability if I stray from this manifesto or if there are improvements I can make as a leader. 

**Being Human:**

I don’t believe in the traditional “Work/Life Balance”. The word “balance” implies there’s a very trepidatious line between the two worlds that you must continue to separate. I believe in allowing everyone to bring their full self to work. I know we all have commitments and responsibilities and will bring our humanity to work. I welcome this. If we can not be humans together, we can not create something authentic and beautiful together. I also believe work will inevitably influence life. As it should. Work is something we can find fulfillment and pride in as we solve problems together, empower users, and grow as a team. My hope is work allows you as an individual to feel connected and fulfilled so you show up in other areas of your life with enthusiasm and a sense of purpose. 

**Hours Of Operation:** 

I believe we are living in a digital age and fully take advantage of the “new way we work.” I respect individuals to know how and when they work best, and if you do not have a set pattern, will help  establish that schedule with you.

I believe it’s just as important for people to manage their energy as well as their time. I expect my team to show up fully, which means I expect you to refresh when needed. I do not do believe we work a “Nine To Five” job. However, I do expect to have everyone committed to core hours where collaboration and synchronous work can occur. During team meetings and core hours, I expect to be able to reach you and you to have access to me. I may sometimes send a slack message or email outside of our agreed upon work hours but that is my choice and unless stated as ‘urgent’, can wait until you’re back the following work day. 

**Team Differences:**

I prefer to work with teams who have a diverse background. I want teams who approach problems with several possible solutions and a variety of experiences that can influence decisions. This means I expect passionate discussions and conversations that provide alternate views. I expect conflict in the best sense of the word, “conflicting ideas” because it provides options. I encourage everyone to consider deeply and “kick the tires” of every proposed solution. I expect honest feedback in the moment. 

In return, I believe the space you share should be safe from criticism or shame. Every voice should be heard. In the end, I also believe for the good of the team, if a decision is made, for better or worse, we collaborate and continue until we learn otherwise. I believe we are agile and we can shift and learn as we go. This is how great products and great teams are made. 

**Psychological Safety:**

The first rule I abide by is always “assume good intent.” I believe everyone does their best with the information they have at the time and when more information is available, they may change that decision. When reviewing code, I assume good intent first - which is to ask questions about the approach instead of assuming a better solution. 

I believe teams do best when they are connected as humans and encourage team lunches and personal connections. If this is not your thing, I also respect introverted individuals and welcome their own ways of connecting. I’m open to that conversation and prefer to acknowledge how each person finds safety in a group without dictating it. 

As an architect and developer, I’ve made many mistakes and I have often joked of “error driven development.” I understand sometimes the best way forward in unknown situation is through “bashing rocks together” and figuring something out in real time. I do not believe we have to have the answers, but rather expect we are willing to show up to figure out a problem together. 

1:1s

I want to connect with individuals in a 1:1 weekly to start. We can evaluate that schedule as we move forward but in order for me to fully understand and be available for your career growth, I plan on having a sync with you at least once a week for 30min to start. 

This is your time. My promise is to show up fully for you. I will have a document we can keep track of an agenda if you work that way best. I encourage you to think of questions or present issues as you see fit so I can help as best I can during our time together. 

**Recognizing Diversity:**

I’m a mother of person on the Autism Spectrum, so I appreciate the different ways strengths and challenges present themself. I understand there is beautiful contribution in ways that might not fit in to social norms. If you are uncomfortable with a task, I’m open to a conversation about why and how we can best work with your strengths as an individual. 

**My Strengths:**

I left this part for last because I believe my success as a leader and a people manager is not my own strengths but the team’s. I also acknowledge it can be helpful for some to connect with me as a person if they know what and how I have succeeded as an engineer in my career. 

First and foremost, I am good at troubleshooting. I learn best working out a problem and finding out how something works. Solving build issues is particularly rewarding since they can be so tricky.

I think in patterns. Having been an architect and lead developer for many years, I’m better at looking at how the different pieces may work together than developing the specific feature itself. I prefer working with the many different teams that create a product than to be siloed in my own “user story” to complete. 

I like to understand the “why”. When asked to solve a problem, I ask “why are we solving this?” first. It’s not because I do not see the value, but rather to understand why we need to think about a solution which can help drive the final outcome. “Why are we creating this particular component?” can sometimes pivot the conversation to “We need to deliver these three options, not this one component.” I encourage everyone to ask why. 

**Feedback:**

I’m open to your feedback. I do not take flippant comments seriously because it would result in reactive and defensive conversations, which are not productive. However, I take thoughtful and honest feedback to heart in the same spirit in which it is presented. 

If you have feedback, I’m available during our 1:1s or asynchronously on slack or our shared quip document, if that’s our running asynchronous documentation. I also encourage you to have Skip Level conversations. You are encouraged to have conversations with my manager as well. Your voice matters because your career matters; not only to you but to our entire ecosystem. I encourage and welcome honest, transparent voices and in return I promise to do the same.
